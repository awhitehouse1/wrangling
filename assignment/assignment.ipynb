        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The paper is about tidying data so that the dataset has a specific structure. This structure is easy to achieve with any messy dataset because it only requires a small set of tools.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * It is intended to make data cleaning easier by providing a framework that standardizes the data cleaning process. Because cleaning data makes up 80% of data analysis, this framework makes the entire data analysis process much simpler and easier.  \n",
        "  \n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * All tidy datasets have the same structure, making them all alike. Messy datasets, however, do not have a standardized structure or layout. This means that messy datasets could all be strutured and organized in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * It is easy to figure out the observations and variables in a dataset because the observations correspond with the rows and the variables with the columns. It can be hard to define variables and observations in general depending on the context of the data. In some situations, variables may actually seem like values of a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Values are strings or integers that belong to variables and observations. A variable contains all observations that measure the same underlying attribute across units. An observation is all of the values measured for the same unit accross all attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * In a tidy dataset, every variable has a column, every observation is a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are that the column headers are values, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in one table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The data in Table 4 are messy because the column names should actually be values in the dataset. The income levels should be put under a column labeled 'Income'. A new column should be created with the frequency that each level of income occured for each religion.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Melting a dataset means turning the columns into rows, making the dataset \"longer\".\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Table 11 is messy because it has variables stored in individual columns and accross rows. The days should be removed from the column names and should be stored as variables instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Table 12(a) is molten because it contains a melted version of table 11, where the day values have been melted into the date column. This table is not tidy because it contains the variables \"tmin\" and \"tmax\" as values in the element column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Table 12(b) is tidy because every row is an observation (a single day) and each variable has a column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Tidy data is only as useful as the tidy tools that work with the data, thus linking the tidy tools to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * He hopes that others will build upon his framework to develop better storage strategies and data cleaning tools. He also hopes to better understand the cognitive side of data analysis, so that better tools can be designed."

        "**Q3.** Many important datasets contain a race variable, typically limited to a handful of values often including Black, White, Asian, Latino, and Indigenous. This question looks at data gathering efforts on this variable by the U.S. Federal government.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How did the most recent US Census gather data on race?\n",
        "\n",
        "* The US census gathered data on race by presenting individuals with a check box style quesiton. Individuals could self-identify and check one or more of the options listed. (https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why do we gather these data? What role do these kinds of data play in politics and society? Why does data quality matter?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Data collected about race is for many different policy making decisions. For example, it can be used to promote equal employment opportunities, assess racial disparities in health, and make policy decisions related to civil rights. The quality of this data is important because if certain groups were excluded from the survey, they could be underrepresented in public policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
        "\n",
        "* I think allowing individuals to identify more than one race is an aspect that was done well with the survey. This was not allowed in the past, which would have negatively impacted the quality of the data. I think that being able to choose multiple answers that you feel best describes you is a good practice that should be adopted more widely to gather more useful data. I think that the census could include more races in order to minimize the number of people who check \"other\" for this question. This would cause the survey to more accurately reflect the diversity of the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How did the Census gather data on sex and gender? Please provide a similar constructive criticism of their practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The census gathered data on sex by asking if the respondent was either male or female. The Census Bureau is starting to ask about gender identity by allowing respondents to choose \"male\", \"female\", \"transgender\", or \"None of these\".\n",
        "\n",
        "* I think the Census Bureau should include more gender identity options so that the number of people who select \"None of these\" is smaller. Having more options would better reflect the diversity of the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When it comes to cleaning data, what concerns do you have about protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race? What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why?\n",
        "\n",
        "* For protected characteristics, like race, that a person can have multiple of, I would be concerned that these multiple identities could be lost during the data cleaning process. Cleaning the data so that respondents are only described by a single race would be a bad practice.\n",
        "* Another bad practice would be imputing the missing values for protected characteristics. Estimating values for these characteristics could create biased and inaccurate data that does not actually represent the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Suppose someone invented an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality. What kinds of concerns would you have?\n",
        "\n",
        "* All algorithms have some kind of bias, so I would be concerned that this algorithm would add bias to the data. This would affect how accurately the data reflects the diversity of the population. Public policies that are made as a result of the data would not be as effective as they could be."

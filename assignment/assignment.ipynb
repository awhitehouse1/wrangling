        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The paper is about tidying data so that the dataset has a specific structure. This structure is easy to achieve with any messy dataset because it only requires a small set of tools.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * It is intended to make data cleaning easier by providing a framework that standardizes the data cleaning process. Because cleaning data makes up 80% of data analysis, this framework makes the entire data analysis process much simpler and easier.  \n",
        "  \n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * All tidy datasets have the same structure, making them all alike. Messy datasets, however, do not have a standardized structure or layout. This means that messy datasets could all be strutured and organized in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * It is easy to figure out the observations and variables in a dataset because the observations correspond with the rows and the variables with the columns. It can be hard to define variables and observations in general depending on the context of the data. In some situations, variables may actually seem like values of a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Values are strings or integers that belong to variables and observations. A variable contains all observations that measure the same underlying attribute across units. An observation is all of the values measured for the same unit accross all attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * In a tidy dataset, every variable has a column, every observation is a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are that the column headers are values, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in one table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The data in Table 4 are messy because the column names should actually be values in the dataset. The income levels should be put under a column labeled 'Income'. A new column should be created with the frequency that each level of income occured for each religion.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Melting a dataset means turning the columns into rows, making the dataset \"longer\".\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Table 11 is messy because it has variables stored in individual columns and accross rows. The days should be removed from the column names and should be stored as variables instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Table 12(a) is molten because it contains a melted version of table 11, where the day values have been melted into the date column. This table is not tidy because it contains the variables \"tmin\" and \"tmax\" as values in the element column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Table 12(b) is tidy because every row is an observation (a single day) and each variable has a column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Tidy data is only as useful as the tidy tools that work with the data, thus linking the tidy tools to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * He hopes that others will build upon his framework to develop better storage strategies and data cleaning tools. He also hopes to better understand the cognitive side of data analysis, so that better tools can be designed."
